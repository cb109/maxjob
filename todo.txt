- inject via copying backend-load script to early startup location?
  or by creating a copy of the wanted script and adding a filein on top (log that)?
- add CLI with options like mxs/py script, max version, usual flags like -server etc.
- try to find sane defaults like the max version e.g. by looking at the registry
- think about configuration via cmdline args, config file, env vars, ...
- all output should probably be put in a file by default.
- use logging everywhere, probably also for logging to file and handling the queue
- make sure to document limitations (e.g. openLog() etc.)
- it might be nice to have a one file .exe build of this once the CLI is there
