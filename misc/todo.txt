- add CLI with options like mxs/py script, max version, usual flags like -server, auto-shutdown etc.
- try to find sane defaults like the max version e.g. by looking at the registry
- think about configuration via cmdline args, config file, env vars, ...
- all output should probably be put in a file by default.
- use logging everywhere, probably also for logging to file and handling the queue
- make sure to document limitations (e.g. openLog() etc.)
- copying the maxscript may be a problem when trying to use getThisScriptFileName() so it should be optional (but then we have to modify it), or in the same directory
